## About Me

<div style="font-size:0.9em; color:#6a737d; margin:-6px 0 12px;">Updated Sep 2025</div>

I'm a graduate student at North Carolina State University pursuing an M.S. in Computer Engineering. I also serve as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, where I work as an embedded systems engineer. I design AI HW platforms for precision and sustainable agriculture. Previously, I worked at Arm on System Architecture Compliance (2023-2025) and as an RF engineer at Qualcomm (2021–2023) in the Modem Software Team. I earned my B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from RVCE, Bangalore in 2021.

My expertise lies in embedded software designs, device driver development, and other hardware-centric software design. I have been working with Arm A and M Class devices since last three years. I am proficient in developing and deploying bare metal implementations for embedded targets, designing end-to-end protocol stacks, and bringing up software for application-class devices from scratch. Additionally, I have over five years of experience in PCB CAD design and I'm always eager to explore and experiment with interesting hardware projects.

At Arm, I worked on a firmware validation framework for Arm A‑profile (A‑class) devices focused on platform security compliance. I was a contributor and maintainer of the FF‑A ACS (Firmware Framework for Arm A‑profile Architecture Compliance Suite), leading test design, fixes, and coverage to validate inter‑world communication and specification compliance.
