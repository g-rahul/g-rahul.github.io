## About Me
I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineer working at Arm on Platform Security Compliance. Previously, I worked as an RF engineer at Qualcomm (2021-2023) in the Modem Software Team. I earned my Electrical and Electronics Engineering bachelor's from RVCE, Bangalore in 2021.

My expertise lies in embedded software designs, device driver development, and other hardware-centric software design. I have been working with Arm A and M Class devices since last three years. I am proficient in developing and deploying bare metal implementations for embedded targets, designing end-to-end protocol stacks, and bringing up software for application-class devices from scratch. Additionally, I have over five years of experience in PCB CAD design and I'm always eager to explore and experiment with interesting hardware projects.

My focus over the past year has been on the security paradigms of embedded systems. I aim to address security challenges in edge devices and have been actively contributing to NuttX and PX4.
